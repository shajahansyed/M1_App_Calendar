## Research
Calendars are useful tools for keeping track of upcoming meetings, deadlines, and milestones. They can help you visualize your schedule and remind you of important events, such as holidays and vacation time.

It’s no wonder that people often have a variety of calendar tools to choose from, including everything from a paper calendar on their office wall to a calendar management tool, such as Calendly. 

The problem is that people too often manage multiple calendars at once. When these calendars aren’t integrated with your work and synchronized with each other, this can lead to mass confusion, headaches, and missed deadlines.
